mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Math Algorithms

This project contains implementations for Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for finding primes up to the n-th number.

### Sieve of Eratosthenes
This algorithm is implemented in the most basic way I know how. It uses a simple vector to preprocess all the primes.
